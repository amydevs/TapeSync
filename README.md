# TapeSync
A rough draft of a script that adds synchorization via Google Drive to [Aeriform Tape](https://www.aeriform.io/docs/tape) (I am in no way associated with the product btw, this is simply a mod).
I'll probably add more sync folder options in the future. However in the mean time, feel free to modify the code for your own cloud synchronisation service. 

## Compile Instructions: 
1. Install node.js
2. Clone this repository locally and `cd` to it.
3. Run `npm install` and then `node .`

If you don't wanna compile it yourself, there are prepackaged binaries you can download in [releases](https://github.com/jy1263/TapeSync/releases/)
